title: Binary Search tree Pixel game
categories: Java
---
  Use the binary search tree to create a pixel game.
The program that displays the graphical objects will receive as input a file containing a list of names of image files, each corresponding to a graphical object. The objects will be rendered on a window and the user will move some them around using the keyboard. Graphical objects cannot overlap, so your program will allow an object to move only when its movement would not cause it to overlap with other objects or with the borders of the window. For this assignment, there will be four kinds of graphical objects: • fixed objects, which cannot move • objects that can be moved by the user • objects that are moved by the computer • target objects, that disappear when the user-controlled objects run into them. These graphical objects will be part of a “pac-man”-like game. Objects moved by the computer will chase the user controlled ones. These latter in turn will try to get rid of the target objects. Fixed objects constrain the movement of the mobile ones. We will provide code for reading the input file, for displaying the graphical objects and for reading the user input.[View][click] the full code of this game.
